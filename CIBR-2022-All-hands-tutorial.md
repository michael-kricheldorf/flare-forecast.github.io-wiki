# Introduction and overview of tutorial

During the 2022 SIBR virtual all-hands meeting, participants will go over a tutorial on how to configure and request execution of a set of retroactive forecast runs using FLARE. This is a capability that can facilitate CIBR researchers to execute batches of retroactive forecast runs. For example, let's say a researcher comes up with a new enhancement to the GLM model or FLARE data assimilation and would like to compare how it fares against a current approach using FCR as a case study. They will be able to use what they learned in this tutorial to run retroactive forecasts for FCR using current and new approach, say, for the entirety of 2020.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

* An overview of the workflow, in particular: where the code, data, and configuration reside, and how the execution takes place using containers
* How to navigate data used by the workflow stored in cloud storage - S3 buckets
* How to create your own "starter lake" by forking from an existing lake
* How to configure the various aspects of your retroactive run
* How to request execution of your retroactive run
* How to view and download results

Participants are encouraged to go over the tutorial on their own desktops during the tutorial, in particular if they plan to do this for their research in the future. Participants may also follow along the screen-shared tutorial on Zoom if they do not run it themselves.
