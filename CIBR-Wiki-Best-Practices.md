## FLARE Wiki Best Practices

We'd like to encourage FLARE team members to contribute as much as possible to the Wiki! Here are some simple best practices to help keep us organized:

### Creating your first page

GitHub provides a fairly intuitive user interface to create new Wiki pages, or edit existing ones - when you navigate to the Wiki page's home, there are two buttons on the upper right hand corner (all the way to the right from Home), for *Edit* and *New Page* 

Writing a new page boils down to mastering how to write markdown - which is relatively simple. [Here is a guide that can help you](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 

If you are not familiar with markdown, you can start by copying the contents of an existing page that you think matches the kind of organization you have in mind (navigate to the page, click Edit to see the markdown, then copy - but don't save the page), copying it to your new page (in a different window), and work from there.

Don't forget to hit the "Save Page" button at the lower right corner, when you're done editing!

### Adding your page to the main table of contents

Once you've created content, you may want to highlight it in one of the tables in the main page.

If your page naturally belongs to one of the interest topics (e.g. "FLARE Guide for Users and Technicians"), feel free to go ahead and add to that topic's table - follow the template you see in the table, and add a row to the bottom.

If you feel like you're not sure where your new page belongs, and/or you feel like it'd be best to create a new table, please first run it by one of the project PIs

### Editing existing pages for clarity/English

If you see any pages that could use some minor English polishing to improve clarity, and you feel comfortable that your changes are not going to require a review for correctness, feel free to go ahead and edit the page

### Comments to improve pages

Unfortunately, there is no simple mechanism to add comments/suggestions to a page without changing the page. If you would like to make suggestions/comments without changing the content, please post your comments to the [CIBR user's list](https://groups.io/g/CIBR-FLARE), with a link to the page you're referring to
